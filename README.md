## üìñ Overview  
This repo includes scripts and notebooks used to process climate data, run crop model simulations, and analyze potential impacts of climate change on *Theobroma cacao* production. The workflow integrates NASA NEX-GDDP climate projections with the ALMANAC crop model and supporting utilities.

## üìÇ Repository Contents  

- **`NEX.ipynb`** ‚Äì Jupyter notebook for downloading and processing NEX-GDDP CMIP6 climate data and analyzing ALMANAC output.  
- **`auto_GUI.py`** ‚Äì Python script for interacting with the ALMANAC model‚Äôs GUI automatically.  
- **`failed_downloads.txt`** ‚Äì Log of unsuccessful climate data downloads.  
- **`labeled_clicks.txt`** ‚Äì Log file for automated GUI actions.  
- **`position_logger.py`** ‚Äì Helper script to record screen positions for GUI automation.  

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements  

- Python ‚â• 3.8  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Common libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `xarray`, `netCDF4`, `requests`, `selenium` (or similar GUI automation library)  

## üöÄ Usage

1. Open NEX.ipynb in Jupyter to reproduce data preprocessing and download routines.
2. Check failed_downloads.txt for any missing files and re-run as needed.
3. Use position_logger.py to calibrate screen positions for GUI automation. 
4. Run auto_GUI.py to automate ALMANAC model simulations (requires local installation of ALMANAC).
